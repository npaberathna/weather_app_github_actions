# 4. Understanding GitHub Actions & Workflows

## What is a Workflow?
An **automatic task** that runs when you push code.

## Example:
```
You push code → GitHub detects it → Runs tests → Deploys website
```

## Our Workflows:

| File | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `ci.yml` | Tests and builds code |
| `static.yml` | Deploys to GitHub Pages |

## Where are Workflow Files?
```
.github/
  └── workflows/
      ├── ci.yml        ← Testing
      └── static.yml    ← Deployment
```

## How to Check if Workflow Worked:
1. Go to your repo
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Look for:
   - ✅ Green = Success
   - 🟡 Yellow = Running
   - ❌ Red = Failed

# 5. Adding Team Members (Collaborators)

## What is a Collaborator?
A team member who can **edit** your repository.

## Step-by-Step:

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Open your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** (top right)

### Step 2: Find Collaborators
1. Click **Collaborators** (left sidebar)
2. You may need to enter your password

### Step 3: Add Team Member
1. Click **Add people**
2. Enter their **GitHub username**

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER_USERNAME/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

### Step 3: Create Your Own Branch

```

### Step 7: Create Pull Request
See next section!

---

# 7. Creating Pull Requests

## What is a Pull Request (PR)?
A **request** to merge your code into the main project.

## Step-by-Step:

### Step 1: Push Your Branch First
```bash
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

### Step 2: Go to GitHub
Open the repository in your browser

### Step 3: You'll See a Yellow Banner
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ feature/your-name had recent pushes             │
│                    [Compare & pull request]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
Click **"Compare & pull request"**

### Step 4: Fill in PR Details
- **Title:** Short description (e.g., "Add backend feature")
- **Description:** What you changed

### Step 5: Click "Create pull request"

✅ **Done!** The owner will review and merge your code!

---

# 8. Merging Pull Requests

## Who Can Merge?
The **repository owner** or collaborators with permission.

## Step-by-Step for Owner:

### Step 1: Go to Pull Requests Tab
Click **"Pull requests"** in your repository

### Step 2: Click on the PR
Select the pull request you want to merge

### Step 3: Review the Changes
- Click **"Files changed"** to see what changed
- Make sure it looks correct

### Step 4: Merge
1. Click **"Merge pull request"** (green button)
2. Click **"Confirm merge"**

### Step 5: (Optional) Delete Branch
Click **"Delete branch"** to clean up

✅ **Done!** The code is now in main branch!

# 9. Branch Strategy Explained

## What is a Branch?
A **separate copy** of code where you can make changes without affecting the main project.

## Our Branch Structure:

```
main (production - live website)
  ↑
  └── feature/sanjani-backend
  └── feature/pavithra-frontend
  └── feature/manoj-devops
```

## Branch Types:

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Live production code |
| `develop` | Testing before going live |
| `feature/*` | Individual work |

## How It Works:

```
1. Create feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Push your branch
4. Create Pull Request
5. Get it reviewed
6. Merge to main
7. Website updates automatically!
```
